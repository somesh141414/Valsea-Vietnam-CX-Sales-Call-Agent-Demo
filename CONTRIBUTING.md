# Contributing to Agora Conversational AI Next.js Quickstart

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher (see `engines` in `package.json`)
- pnpm 8.x or higher
- An Agora account with Conversational AI enabled

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/agent-quickstart-nextjs.git
cd agent-quickstart-nextjs
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in your API keys and credentials in `.env.local`.

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards (see below)

3. Test your changes locally:

```bash
pnpm build
```

4. Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive commit message

5. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

### Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code must be written in TypeScript
- **Formatting**: Follow the existing code style (we use Prettier defaults)
- **Linting**: Ensure your code passes ESLint checks (`pnpm lint .`)
- **Comments**: Add comments for non-obvious patterns, especially:
  - StrictMode guards and React lifecycle patterns
  - Agora SDK-specific requirements
  - Security considerations
  - Performance optimizations

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing patterns for Agora SDK integration:
  - `isReady` guard for StrictMode safety
  - Hook ownership (don't manually call `client.leave()`, etc.)
  - Proper cleanup in `useEffect` returns
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

### API Route Guidelines

- Validate all inputs
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include clear error messages
- Log errors with context
- Never expose sensitive credentials in responses

## Pull Request Process

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Good: "Add support for Azure OpenAI endpoints"
   - Bad: "Update code"

2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes you made and why
   - How to test the changes
   - Any breaking changes
   - Screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review**: Wait for maintainer review
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions focused and professional

4. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
